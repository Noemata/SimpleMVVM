# Simple Microsoft MVVM Toolkit Sample

POC minimal yet plausable MVVM app using Microsoft's MVVM Toolkit.

Description: 

This project incorporates features that compensate for some of the limitations of Microsoft's MVVM Toolkit. The demo app is simple enough to be digestable yet complicated enough to be representative of real world MVVM usage.
